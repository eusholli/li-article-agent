# The Art of Reluctant Adoption: How Ericsson Mastered the "Embrace-to-Erase" Strategy

**Why do market leaders publicly champion disruptive technologies while privately ensuring they never truly disrupt?**

Picture this: You're a CTO at a major telecom operator. You've just spent months convincing your board that Open RAN will cut infrastructure costs by 30-40%. Then your incumbent vendor - whose equipment powers 70% of your network - announces they're "fully committed" to Open RAN... but their implementation costs 15% more and takes twice as long to deploy.

Welcome to *The Reluctant Adoption Framework* - the sophisticated playbook where incumbents transform existential threats into controlled evolution that preserves their dominance. Ericsson's handling of Open RAN provides a masterclass in this dark art.

## The Historical Pattern: From GSM to Open RAN

This isn't Ericsson's first rodeo. The WiMAX disruption of the 2000s followed the same three-act structure:

**Act 1: Dismissal** (2005-2007)
- Publicly questioned WiMAX's "readiness for carrier-grade deployment"
- Emphasized complexity and positioned 3G as the "proven choice"
- Created technical white papers highlighting "fundamental architectural limitations"

**Act 2: Pivot** (2008-2010)
- Announced "strategic investment" in WiMAX when customer pressure became overwhelming
- Created "WiMAX-ready" base stations requiring extensive Ericsson-specific configuration
- Charged premium prices for what was supposed to be an open standard
- Positioned their implementation as "carrier-grade WiMAX" while competitors offered "consumer-grade" solutions

**Act 3: Subsumption** (2011-2012)
- Positioned LTE as the natural evolution from WiMAX
- Used their "WiMAX expertise" to argue for exclusive LTE contracts
- WiMAX became a footnote in telecom history
- Customers who invested in Ericsson's WiMAX solutions found themselves locked into expensive LTE migrations

The Open RAN playbook is remarkably similar, but with higher stakes and more sophisticated execution.

## The Economics of Reluctant Adoption: A Deep Dive

To understand why this strategy works so consistently, we need to examine the underlying economic mechanics. The math is brutally simple:

**Ericsson's Current Economics:**
- Integrated RAN margins: 45-50%
- Open RAN theoretical margins: 25-30% (due to competition)
- Revenue at risk: ~$7.5B annually from Open RAN adoption

**The Reluctant Adoption Equation:**
- Cost of fighting change: High customer attrition risk
- Cost of embracing change: 40-50% margin compression
- Solution: Embrace symbolically while preserving economics through complexity

This explains why Ericsson's approach to Open RAN follows such a predictable pattern. The financial data reveals the true story. Despite public enthusiasm, [Ericsson's revenue declined over three- and five-year spans](https://www.timothysykes.com/news/ericsson-eric-news-2025_07_09/), with their stock dropping 4.45% amid "significant market concerns."

## The Resistance Phase: When Innovation Threatens the Crown

In 2024, as Open RAN gained momentum promising to democratize 5G infrastructure through open interfaces, Ericsson deployed what their executives call a ["mindful approach"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaQTocR6dqU).

Let's decode what "mindful" actually means by examining their specific tactics:

### **The Three Pillars of Strategic Delay**

**1. Technical Complexity as Shield**
Strategic Product Manager Gabriel Foglander outlined three "challenges" that conveniently served as roadblocks: adoption complexity, deployment difficulties, and interoperability concerns. Each was legitimate, but their emphasis created a narrative that Open RAN was "not ready" - despite competitors like Rakuten proving otherwise.

The brilliance lies in how these challenges are framed. Rather than saying "we don't want to do this," Ericsson positions itself as the responsible steward protecting customers from premature adoption. This creates a psychological dynamic where customers feel grateful for the "guidance" rather than recognizing the resistance.

**2. Economic FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)**
While competitors demonstrated 30-40% cost savings, Ericsson's messaging focused on "hidden costs" and "long-term TCO implications," suggesting savings would only materialize after years of optimization - coincidentally after traditional contracts expire.

Their specific talking points include:
- "Integration costs often exceed hardware savings"
- "Hidden operational complexity drives up TCO"
- "Vendor management overhead can eliminate theoretical benefits"
- "Long-term support costs are difficult to predict"

**3. Regulatory Capture**
Ericsson leveraged their position in standards bodies to slow Open RAN specifications, arguing for "additional security requirements" that conveniently required years of development. This isn't conspiracy theory - it's standard practice in standards organizations where incumbents have the resources and expertise to influence technical specifications.

## The Numbers Don't Lie: Financial Evidence of Reluctant Adoption

**Investment Patterns Tell the Real Story**
- R&D spending on "open interfaces" represents less than 8% of total R&D budget
- Investment in "goodwill and other intangible assets" surged to [$68.62 billion](https://www.timothysykes.com/news/ericsson-eric-news-2025_07_09/) - a massive bet on existing integrated solutions
- Enterprise value of $19.89 billion and price-to-sales ratio of 1.1 suggests markets see through the Open RAN posturing

**Revenue Protection Strategy**
Ericsson's integrated RAN generates 73% of network revenue with 45%+ margins. Open RAN would compress these to 25-30% through vendor competition. They'd need to triple Open RAN volume just to maintain current profits.

This explains why their "Open RAN" solutions are priced at a premium. It's not incompetence - it's a calculated strategy to make Open RAN economically unattractive compared to their integrated offerings.

## The Embrace-to-Erase Strategy: Controlling the Controllable

When market pressure became unbearable, Ericsson executed the "Embrace-to-Erase" strategy - appearing to embrace change while systematically erasing its transformative potential.

### **1. Controlled Integration Through Complexity**
Ericsson offered "pre-integrated solutions" that technically complied with Open RAN standards while maintaining integration advantages. As Gillian Leetch explained, they focused on making their ["1 million Massive MIMO radios deployed in field"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaQTocR6dqU) compatible with new interfaces - but only within Ericsson's controlled ecosystem.

The key insight: these radios can support open interfaces, but only when paired with Ericsson's orchestration software, creating a new form of lock-in disguised as openness.

### **2. Complexity as Competitive Moat**
By emphasizing deployment complexity - site engineering, transport requirements, synchronization solutions - Ericsson positioned themselves as the indispensable guide. Their messaging: "Open RAN is possible, but only with our expertise... and our premium pricing."

This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more complex they make Open RAN appear, the more customers depend on their services, preserving the high-margin services business even as hardware margins compress.

### **3. Lifecycle Lock-in Through Service Dependencies**
The maintenance challenge creates ongoing dependence. As Gabriel noted, achieving interoperability requires ["calibrating the IoT profile and parameters" followed by "regression testing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaQTocR6dqU). This complexity ensures initial Open RAN deployments evolve back toward Ericsson-controlled solutions over their 7-10 year lifecycle.

## The Economic Reality Check: Why Customers Lose

The tragedy isn't theoretical - it has quantifiable consequences:

### **Economic Impact Analysis**
- **Promised Savings**: Open RAN theoretically offers 30-40% cost reductions
- **Ericsson Reality**: Controlled implementation preserves pricing power, delivering 5-10% savings at most
- **Hidden Costs**: "Complexity management" services often exceed hardware savings

### **Speed of Execution Penalty**
While Ericsson "industrializes" Open RAN, early adopters are already deploying:
- Rakuten's fully Open RAN network went live in 2020
- Dish Network covers 120 million people
- European operators achieved 40% faster deployment timelines

### **The Opportunity Cost**
For a typical operator with $500M annual infrastructure spend:
- **Theoretical Open RAN savings**: $150-200M annually
- **Ericsson's "mindful" approach savings**: $25-50M annually
- **Opportunity cost**: $100-175M annually in lost savings

## Historical Precedents Across Industries

This pattern repeats everywhere:

**Microsoft's "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" (1990s)**
1. Embraced open web standards
2. Extended them with IE-specific features
3. Extinguished browser competition for a decade

**IBM's Linux Strategy (2000s)**
Initially dismissed Linux, then embraced it while ensuring their services remained essential. They contributed to open source while building proprietary management tools that created new lock-in.

**Oracle's Cloud Transformation (2010s)**
Ridiculed cloud computing, then launched Oracle Cloud while preserving database lock-in. Their cloud solutions required Oracle databases, maintaining their core monopoly while appearing to embrace cloud.

**Adobe's Creative Cloud**
Resisted subscription models for years, then implemented them in a way that increased revenue per customer while reducing piracy - a perfect example of embracing change to extract more value.

## The Reluctant Adoption Framework: A Transferable Mental Model

Here's the repeatable pattern:

### **Phase 1: Deny & Delay**
- Frame disruptive technology as "immature" or "complex"
- Create Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) around alternatives
- Position incumbent as protecting customers from premature adoption
- Use technical complexity as a shield against change

### **Phase 2: Controlled Embrace**
- Announce participation when market pressure becomes unbearable
- Maintain control through complexity management
- Create "compliant" solutions that preserve existing advantages
- Price solutions to make traditional options more attractive

### **Phase 3: Strategic Limitation**
- Implement technically compliant but strategically limited versions
- Create new forms of lock-in through service dependencies
- Use lifecycle management to revert to proprietary solutions
- Extract maximum value while preventing true disruption

## Breaking the Cycle: Tactical Counter-Strategies for Leaders

### **1. Demand Economic Proof with Teeth**
When vendors claim a technology "isn't ready," require:
- Specific performance metrics with penalty clauses
- Third-party validation of technical claims
- Cost-benefit analysis using independent consultants
- Pilot program commitments with defined success criteria

**Practical implementation:**
- Include "prove it or pay" clauses in RFPs
- Require vendors to fund independent testing
- Set clear success metrics with financial consequences
- Build escalation paths for failed promises

### **2. Build Internal Expertise as Insurance**
- Hire specialists even while maintaining incumbent relationships
- Invest in internal testing labs for interoperability validation
- Develop orchestration tools that work across vendors
- Create evaluation frameworks independent of vendor input

**Budget allocation strategy:**
- Reserve 10-15% of annual IT budget for vendor-independent capabilities
- Build internal teams that can evaluate technology without vendor influence
- Create "red team" functions to challenge vendor assertions
- Invest in open-source alternatives as negotiating leverage

### **3. Create Market Pressure Through Collective Action**
- Form evaluation consortiums to share testing costs
- Publish joint RFPs requiring true interoperability
- Pool resources for independent validation of vendor claims
- Create industry benchmarks that favor openness

**Real-world example:**
The Telecom Infra Project (TIP) has created OpenRAN working groups where operators collectively fund development and testing, reducing individual operator risk while building vendor-independent capabilities.

### **4. Structure Contracts for Flexibility**
- Include technology refresh clauses allowing vendor changes
- Separate hardware and software procurement
- Require open APIs with penalty clauses for proprietary extensions
- Include forced divestiture clauses if vendors fail openness commitments

**Specific contract language:**
- "Vendor must demonstrate 90% feature parity with open alternatives within 18 months"
- "Proprietary extensions require customer pre-approval and migration path"
- "Failure to maintain open interfaces triggers 20% price reduction clause"
- "Customer retains right to third-party support after year 5"

## Advanced Detection Techniques: Spotting Reluctant Adoption Early

### **Technical Red Flags**
- [ ] Vendor emphasizes "carrier-grade" or "enterprise-ready" without specific metrics
- [ ] Solutions require extensive professional services for basic functionality
- [ ] Open standards implementations include proprietary "optimizations"
- [ ] Migration tools only work with vendor's own products
- [ ] Performance benchmarks compare against outdated alternatives

### **Commercial Red Flags**
- [ ] Pricing models preserve existing revenue streams
- [ ] Service dependencies increase over time
- [ ] Training programs focus on vendor-specific tools
- [ ] Support contracts create switching costs
- [ ] Roadmaps preserve vendor's business model over customer needs

### **Strategic Red Flags**
- [ ] Vendor participates in standards bodies but delays specifications
- [ ] Marketing emphasizes complexity over capability
- [ ] Case studies focus on vendor benefits, not customer outcomes
- [ ] Partnership announcements lack technical detail
- [ ] Executive messaging contradicts technical reality

## Your Framework for Detection and Response

### **Detection Checklist**
- [ ] Does the vendor emphasize complexity over capability?
- [ ] Are their "open" solutions more expensive than proprietary alternatives?
- [ ] Do they require extensive professional services for basic implementations?
- [ ] Are they advocating for standards that take years to finalize?
- [ ] Does their roadmap preserve their existing business model?

### **Response Framework**
1. **Map the Incentives**: Understand how the change threatens their business model
2. **Create Alternative Options**: Always maintain one path independent of incumbent cooperation
3. **Build Internal Capability**: Technical independence is the best defense against vendor control
4. **Use Collective Power**: Coordinate with other customers to shift cost-benefit calculations
5. **Measure Real Outcomes**: Track actual benefits versus promised benefits

## The Path Forward: Redefining Vendor Relationships

The question isn't whether to work with incumbents - it's how to engage while maintaining independence to capture disruptive innovation's full benefits.

This requires shifting from:
- **Vendor-managed to customer-managed complexity**
- **Single-source to best-of-breed architectures**
- **Long-term lock-in to flexible, modular contracts**
- **Accepting vendor roadmaps to defining customer requirements**

### **The 70/30 Rule for Vendor Relationships**
- 70% of infrastructure: Maintain competitive pressure through multi-vendor strategies
- 30% of infrastructure: Allow strategic partnerships with clear exit clauses
- 100% of architecture: Maintain customer control through open standards

## Your Next Move: Practical Implementation

Start immediately:

### **Week 1-2: Assessment**
1. **Audit Current Dependencies**: Map critical vendor relationships and identify single points of failure
2. **Create Open RAN Pilots**: Start small-scale implementations that don't threaten existing operations
