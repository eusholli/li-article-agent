# The Art of Reluctant Adoption: How Ericsson Masters the Dark Art of Controlled Innovation

**Why the biggest players in tech don't resist change—they choreograph it.**

## The Paradox That Keeps Giants Giant

Every industry has them: the incumbents who claim to drive innovation while secretly working to ensure disruption never truly disrupts their dominance. In telecommunications, Ericsson has perfected what I call "reluctant adoption"—a sophisticated strategy where market leaders appear to embrace disruptive technologies while systematically ensuring these innovations never threaten their core business model.

This isn't conspiracy theory. It's strategic choreography visible in the evolution from traditional RAN to Open RAN, where Ericsson's behavior reveals a playbook that extends far beyond telecom. Understanding this pattern doesn't just explain why your 5G deployment costs haven't dropped—it illuminates how dominant players across industries maintain control while appearing to compete.

**The uncomfortable truth**: When incumbents "embrace" disruption, they often do so like a chess master accepting a sacrifice—on terms that ultimately strengthen their position.

## The Three-Act Play of Controlled Innovation

### Act I: The Resistance Phase (Manufacturing Doubt)

When Open RAN emerged as a concept to disaggregate the monolithic radio access network into standardized, interoperable components, Ericsson's initial response followed a predictable pattern. Rather than engaging with the technology's potential, they positioned themselves as responsible industry stewards protecting customers from "immature" solutions.

The strategy was subtle but effective. While 3GPP had defined eight functional split options for RAN disaggregation as early as Release 14, Ericsson emphasized the complexity and risk of moving away from integrated systems. They highlighted challenges around interoperability without acknowledging that these challenges existed precisely because incumbents like themselves had spent decades building proprietary, closed systems.

This resistance phase serves multiple purposes:
- **Delay market adoption** until the incumbent can develop a response
- **Frame the narrative** around incumbent expertise versus startup recklessness
- **Preserve existing revenue streams** from integrated solutions
- **Maintain customer lock-in** through continued dependence on proprietary systems
- **Create artificial complexity** that only the incumbent can navigate

Consider the psychology at work: When Ericsson claims Open RAN is "too complex," they're not lying—they've simply ensured complexity through decades of proprietary design. It's like a locksmith who designed your house's security system claiming only they can change the locks because the system is "too sophisticated" for anyone else to understand.

### Act II: The Strategic Pivot (Controlled Leadership)

When market pressure becomes overwhelming—driven by operators facing 70% of their capital expenditure tied up in RAN equipment—Ericsson executes a masterful pivot. Suddenly, they're not resisting Open RAN; they're leading it.

Consider Ericsson's public positioning: they now support "the widest ecosystem of supported devices on 5G live networks" with 111+ commercial 5G agreements. They claim leadership in 5G standards with 15.8% of patent declarations. But notice what's missing from this narrative: any commitment to the multi-vendor interoperability that makes Open RAN valuable.

This pivot follows a precise formula:
1. **Claim technological leadership** while controlling the implementation timeline
2. **Redefine "open"** to mean "Ericsson-compatible" rather than truly vendor-agnostic
3. **Implement partial solutions** that check marketing boxes without enabling real competition
4. **Position as the safe choice** for risk-averse operators

The genius lies in the messaging: Ericsson doesn't say "Open RAN is bad"—they say "Open RAN must be done right," where "right" coincidentally means maintaining their market position. It's the corporate equivalent of "I'm not saying no, I'm saying let's be responsible about this."

### Act III: The Controlled Implementation (Preservation Through Participation)

Here's where Ericsson's genius becomes visible. When they finally "embrace" Open RAN, they do so on terms that ensure market dynamics remain unchanged. Their Cloud RAN offering passes security audits and achieves compliance, but it's built on proprietary implementations that maintain their ecosystem control.

The numbers tell the story: while Dell'Oro Group forecasts Open RAN reaching 25% of the RAN market by 2028, they simultaneously predict multi-vendor deployments will account for under 10% of this. In other words, operators will adopt "Open RAN" without gaining the vendor diversity and cost reduction that motivated the shift.

**This is reluctant adoption in its purest form**: the appearance of embracing change while ensuring the underlying market structure remains intact.

## The Architecture of Delay: How Giants Weaponize Complexity

### Complexity as Competitive Moat

One analysis found Open RAN could deliver 42% lifecycle cost reduction across 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G services over ten years, with 62% of savings in operational expenses. Yet these benefits remain largely theoretical for most operators.

Why? Because Ericsson has mastered the art of complexity as a competitive moat. When they discuss Open RAN challenges, they focus on three areas: adoption, deployment, and interoperability. But they frame these as technical challenges requiring their expertise rather than market opportunities enabled by standardization.

Consider their approach to existing infrastructure: "we have some 1 million macro radios deployed in field that can use the new open interface." The message seems collaborative—existing Ericsson equipment can work with Open RAN. But the subtext is clear: Open RAN must accommodate Ericsson's legacy systems, not the other way around.

This creates a fascinating economic paradox: the very complexity that Open RAN aims to solve becomes the reason operators stick with their incumbent vendor. It's like being told you can't switch doctors because your medical history is too complex for anyone else to understand.

### The Patent Fortress Strategy

Ericsson's 54,000 standard-essential patents represent more than intellectual property—they're a control mechanism. When Open RAN threatens to commoditize RAN equipment, Ericsson's patent portfolio ensures they maintain pricing power regardless of vendor diversity.

Their 15.8% share of 5G patent declarations isn't just market leadership; it's strategic positioning to ensure that even in a multi-vendor Open RAN world, Ericsson collects rents on the underlying technology. This transforms Open RAN from a threat to their business model into an additional revenue stream.

The brilliance is in the transformation: what started as a technology designed to reduce vendor lock-in becomes a mechanism for perpetual rent collection. Every Open RAN deployment, regardless of vendor, potentially owes Ericsson licensing fees. It's like designing a new transportation system that still requires paying tolls to the same bridge owner.

## Beyond Telecom: The Universal Pattern

### Cloud Computing's Reluctant Adoption

Traditional enterprise vendors initially resisted cloud computing, claiming it was insecure and unreliable. Then came the "hybrid cloud" pivot—where vendors offered cloud solutions that actually preserved on-premise revenue streams. Companies like Oracle and IBM now lead "cloud transformation" while ensuring their traditional licensing models persist.

The pattern is identical:
1. **Denial**: "Cloud is insecure for enterprise workloads"
2. **Redefinition**: "Hybrid cloud is the responsible approach"
3. **Controlled implementation**: Cloud services that require traditional enterprise licenses

Result: Enterprises adopt "cloud" without gaining the cost benefits or flexibility that motivated the shift.

### Electric Vehicles' Controlled Revolution

Legacy automakers delayed EV adoption for decades, claiming range anxiety and charging infrastructure made them impractical. When Tesla forced their hand, they pivoted to "EV leadership" while maintaining dealership models and service revenue streams that EVs should render obsolete.

Consider the maintenance angle: EVs require 40% less maintenance than internal combustion engines, threatening a $400 billion global automotive service market. The response? Position EVs as requiring "specialized expertise" and "certified service centers," ensuring traditional revenue streams persist even as the underlying technology changes.

### Open Source's Enterprise Capture

Proprietary software vendors initially fought open source, claiming it was unreliable and insecure. Then came the "enterprise open source" pivot—where vendors offered supported versions of community software, capturing value from free innovation while maintaining control.

Red Hat's $34 billion acquisition by IBM illustrates the endgame: open source becomes just another delivery mechanism for vendor lock-in, with "enterprise features" creating new dependencies on specific vendors.

## The Second-Order Effects: Why This Matters More Than You Think

### Innovation Slowdown

When controlled innovation becomes the dominant strategy, several cascading effects occur:

**Innovation slows**: True breakthrough innovations require market pressure that controlled innovation diffuses. Why invest in revolutionary technology when you can incrementally improve existing systems while maintaining market position?

**Customer costs remain high**: Without genuine competition, pricing stays elevated. The 42% cost reduction potential of Open RAN remains theoretical because controlled implementation prevents the market dynamics that would deliver those savings.

**Technical debt accumulates**: Legacy systems persist longer because vendors control migration timelines. Ericsson's "1 million macro radios" argument ensures their 20-year-old technology remains relevant, even as it blocks innovation.

**Market concentration increases**: Smaller players can't compete against incumbents who control both old and new paradigms. The RAN market's consolidation to three players (Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei) controlling 80% of revenue demonstrates this effect.

### The GDP Impact Paradox

Research shows mobile broadband adoption drives 0.8% GDP growth for every 10% increase in penetration. Ericsson leverages this economic impact to position their technology as critical infrastructure requiring their stewardship. They become not just vendors but guardians of national economic development.

This positioning allows them to frame Open RAN adoption as risky experimentation rather than competitive evolution. Operators, already managing 7-10 year equipment replacement cycles, become reluctant to disrupt relationships with their primary supplier.

The paradox: the very economic benefits that should drive faster adoption become the reason for maintaining the status quo.

## Breaking the Cycle: A Stakeholder Playbook

### For Network Operators: Demanding Genuine Innovation

For operators seeking genuine Open RAN benefits, the path requires recognizing reluctant adoption strategies and actively countering them:

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Demand interoperability testing** that includes multiple vendors, not just Ericsson-compatible solutions
2. **Invest in internal expertise** to reduce dependence on vendor-defined roadmaps
3. **Structure contracts** to reward interoperability achievements, not just deployment milestones
4. **Create vendor-agnostic evaluation criteria** that measure actual multi-vendor performance

**Strategic Moves:**
1. **Collaborate with other operators** to create market pressure for true multi-vendor deployments
2. **Establish independent testing labs** that validate interoperability claims
3. **Develop internal Open RAN expertise** through training and hiring
4. **Negotiate IPR licensing separately** from equipment purchases to reduce patent leverage

### For Technology Leaders: Recognizing the Pattern

For technology leaders across industries, Ericsson's reluctant adoption strategy offers both warning and instruction. It demonstrates how dominant players can maintain control through strategic choreography rather than technical superiority.

**Key Recognition Signals:**
- **Complexity framing**: When incumbents position new technology as "too complex" for anyone else to implement
- **Partial solutions**: When "embracing" change means implementing features that don't enable core benefits
- **Legacy integration**: When new technology must accommodate old systems rather than replace them
- **Patent positioning**: When IP portfolios expand to cover new paradigms before they're adopted

### For Investors: Valuing True Disruption

Understanding reluctant adoption helps investors distinguish between genuine disruption and orchestrated evolution:

**Red Flags:**
- Incumbent "leadership" in disruptive technology without corresponding market share shifts
- Technology adoption that preserves incumbent revenue streams
- Complexity arguments that benefit established players

**Green Flags:**
- New entrants gaining market share through superior economics
- Customer switching costs decreasing over time
- Standards bodies dominated by users rather than vendors

## The Mental Model: How to Spot Reluctant Adoption

### The Reluctant Adoption Checklist

Based on Ericsson's playbook, here's how to identify controlled innovation across industries:

**Phase 1: Resistance Detection**
- Claims new technology is "immature" or "complex"
- Positions as protecting customers from risk
- Emphasizes integration challenges they created

**Phase 2: Pivot Recognition**
- Suddenly claims leadership in the "responsible" implementation
- Redefines key terms to preserve advantages
- Offers "hybrid" solutions that maintain old revenue streams

**Phase 3: Implementation Analysis**
- Solutions check marketing boxes without enabling core benefits
- Legacy systems remain central to new paradigms
- Market concentration persists despite "open" approaches

### Transferable Lessons

This pattern appears everywhere:
- **Banking**: Traditional banks "embracing" fintech through controlled APIs
- **Healthcare**: Established providers "adopting" telemedicine within existing fee structures
- **Education**: Universities "offering" online learning at traditional tuition rates

The common thread: incumbents don't resist change—they choreograph it.

## The Critical Question

As we evaluate technology transitions across industries, we must ask: Are we witnessing genuine innovation or controlled innovation? Are new technologies truly disrupting markets, or are dominant players choreographing change to preserve existing power structures?

The next time you hear an industry leader claim to be "embracing disruption," look deeper. Are they leading change, or are they reluctantly adopting it on terms that ensure nothing really changes?

**What patterns of controlled innovation do you see in your industry? How might recognizing these patterns change your approach to technology adoption?**

**For leaders**: How do you distinguish between genuine innovation partnerships and controlled adoption strategies?

**For customers**: What questions should you ask vendors who claim to be "leading" disruptive change?

**For investors**: How do you value companies whose "innovation" preserves rather than disrupts market structures?

*The art of reluctant adoption isn't unique to telecommunications—it's the dominant strategy of incumbents facing disruption. Recognizing it is the first step toward genuine innovation. The question isn't whether change will come, but whether it will come on terms that benefit incumbents or customers.*
