# The Art of Reluctant Adoption: How Telecom Giants Master the "Embrace to Erase" Strategy

**When resistance becomes strategy, and adoption becomes control.**

Picture this: A revolutionary technology emerges that threatens to democratize an entire industry. The incumbents first dismiss it as impractical. Then they warn it's dangerous. Finally, when market pressure becomes unbearable, they announce they'll "lead the charge" to implement it properly. But something curious happens—the technology never quite delivers on its original promise. The market stays exactly where it was. The incumbents remain on top. And everyone wonders why the revolution fizzled.

Welcome to the art of *reluctant adoption*—a masterful strategy perfected by telecom's reigning giants, Nokia and Ericsson. They've transformed the act of embracing disruptive innovation into a sophisticated form of controlled demolition.

## The Open RAN Revolution That Wasn't

**By opening up the traditional telecoms equipment supply market, Open RAN aims to reduce reliance on a handful of dominant providers and inject innovation through supplier diversification**([source](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/)). The promise was intoxicating: mobile operators could finally mix and match equipment from different vendors, breaking free from the chokehold of Ericsson, Nokia, and Huawei—who collectively control [75% of the global RAN equipment market revenue in 2023](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/).

But here's where the story gets interesting. Instead of fighting Open RAN head-on, the incumbents did something far more sophisticated. They *adopted* it.

## The Economic Mechanics of Reluctant Adoption

Before diving into the telecom specifics, let's examine the fundamental economics that make reluctant adoption work. At its core, this strategy exploits three market dynamics:

### 1. Information Asymmetry
Incumbents possess deep technical knowledge about both legacy and emerging technologies. When Open RAN emerged, Ericsson and Nokia understood its limitations better than anyone—they'd spent decades building the integrated systems it aimed to replace. This knowledge asymmetry allows them to shape customer expectations around "readiness" in ways that favor their existing solutions.

The key insight here is that incumbents don't need to lie about the technology's limitations. They simply need to control which limitations matter most. When Ericsson highlights performance concerns in high-density areas, they're not fabricating these issues—they're selecting which technical challenges to emphasize based on their strategic advantage.

### 2. Switching Cost Amplification
By controlling the implementation narrative, incumbents can artificially inflate perceived switching costs. They highlight integration complexity, performance risks, and accountability gaps until the pain of change exceeds the promised benefits. As [operators have been reluctant to fully diversify the supply chain](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/) due to concerns about network accountability and integration challenges, this strategy proves particularly effective.

Consider the hidden costs they emphasize: vendor coordination overhead, multi-vendor testing cycles, performance optimization complexity, and the need for new operational skills. Each legitimate concern becomes another reason to stick with the "safe" integrated solution.

### 3. Risk Aversion Exploitation
Humans systematically prefer predictable mediocrity over uncertain improvement. Incumbents exploit this by framing their controlled implementations as the "safe" choice, making true diversification feel reckless rather than strategic.

This psychological leverage is particularly powerful in telecom, where network outages can cost millions per hour. By positioning themselves as the "responsible" choice, incumbents transform market pressure into a competitive moat.

## The Three-Phase Reluctant Adoption Framework

### Phase 1: The Resistance Narrative

When Open RAN first emerged, both Nokia and Ericsson deployed what I call the "resistance narrative." This isn't outright rejection—it's strategic skepticism wrapped in concern for customer welfare.

The messaging was consistent: *"We support open standards, but the technology isn't ready for prime time."* Ericsson emphasized performance concerns in high-density areas. Nokia highlighted integration challenges with legacy systems. Both positioned themselves as protecting operators from making costly mistakes.

**The genius of this phase**: By acknowledging the technology's potential while emphasizing its limitations, they maintain credibility while slowing adoption. They're not against progress—they're for *responsible* progress.

### Phase 2: The Strategic Pivot

When market pressure reached a tipping point—driven by government mandates, operator frustration, and competitive threats—the incumbents executed a masterful pivot. They didn't just accept Open RAN; they positioned themselves as its *saviors*.

Consider these announcements:
- [AT&T's massive contract with Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2023/12/att-to-accelerate-open-and-interoperable-radio-access-networks-ran-in-the-united-states-through-new-collaboration-with-ericsson) to "accelerate open and interoperable radio access networks"
- [Deutsche Telekom's partnership with Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2023/12/12/nokia-and-deutsche-telekom-begin-deployment-of-multi-vendor-open-ran-network-in-germany/) for "multi-vendor Open RAN deployment"
- [NTT DOCOMO's Nokia partnership](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2023/11/20/nokia-deploys-energy-efficient-multi-supplier-o-ran-5g-network-with-ntt-docomo/) for "energy-efficient multi-supplier O-RAN"

Notice the language: "accelerate," "enable," "drive innovation." The incumbents transformed from Open RAN skeptics to Open RAN champions.

**The critical insight**: They didn't pivot because they believed in Open RAN's promise. They pivoted because they realized they could control its implementation.

### Phase 3: The Controlled Implementation

Here's where reluctant adoption reveals its genius. The incumbents implement Open RAN in ways that *technically* fulfill the requirements while *strategically* undermining its transformative potential.

The mechanism works like this: Instead of creating truly open, interoperable systems, they create "Open RAN" solutions that require their specific hardware, their specific software, and their specific integration services. The result is a system that checks the Open RAN compliance box while recreating the exact same vendor lock-in the technology was designed to eliminate.

**Real-world example**: When Ericsson won AT&T's $14 billion Open RAN contract, industry analysts quickly noted it was effectively a single-vendor deal. The "open" network would run primarily on Ericsson equipment, with Ericsson integration, under Ericsson's roadmap. The revolution became evolution—and evolution favored the incumbent.

## Nokia vs. Ericsson: Two Paths, Same Destination

While both companies practice reluctant adoption, their approaches reveal distinct corporate personalities:

### Nokia's Method: The "Strategic Diversification" Play

Nokia's approach centers on "strategic diversification"—using Open RAN as a gateway to sell *more* Nokia products, not fewer. Their recent evolution of [MantaRAY to Open RAN SMO solution](https://the-mobile-network.com/2025/06/nokia-evolves-mantaray-to-open-ran-smo-solution/) exemplifies this strategy.

Rather than embracing true multi-vendor environments, Nokia positions itself as the "orchestrator" of Open RAN deployments. They provide the software layer, the integration services, and the performance guarantees—effectively becoming the single throat to choke while technically complying with Open RAN requirements.

**The implementation reality**: Nokia's Open RAN solutions often require their specific hardware for optimal performance, their software for orchestration, and their services for integration. The customer gets an "open" system that happens to work best when everything comes from Nokia.

### Ericsson's Method: The "Performance Arbitrage" Strategy

Ericsson takes a different tack, leveraging what I call "performance arbitrage." They acknowledge Open RAN's theoretical benefits while systematically demonstrating its practical limitations.

Their messaging follows a consistent pattern:
- "Open RAN is promising for certain use cases"
- "However, integrated solutions still deliver superior performance"
- "We recommend a phased approach starting with Ericsson's Open RAN solution"

This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. When operators choose Ericsson's "Open RAN" solution, they get Ericsson's hardware, Ericsson's software, and Ericsson's integration—all under the Open RAN banner. The result? [Single-vendor Open RAN deployments that limit supply-chain diversification](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/), exactly what Open RAN was designed to prevent.

**The performance trap**: Ericsson's testing consistently shows their integrated solutions outperform multi-vendor Open RAN deployments. What they don't emphasize is that their "Open RAN" solutions are optimized for their own ecosystem, making fair comparison impossible.

## The Numbers Tell the Story

Let's examine what reluctant adoption has actually achieved:

- **Open RAN market share**: Expected to reach [25% of RAN equipment market by 2028](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/)
- **Multi-vendor deployments**: Will account for [under 10% of Open RAN deployments](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/)
- **RAN market decline**: [11% decrease in 2023](https://www.telecoms.com/wireless-networking/global-ran-market-declined-by-11-in-2023), suggesting operators are delaying decisions rather than diversifying suppliers

**The deeper analysis**: These numbers reveal a market caught between promise and reality. Open RAN adoption is growing, but it's growing in ways that reinforce rather than challenge incumbent positions. The technology that was supposed to democratize the supply chain is instead being used to validate existing vendor relationships.

## Historical Parallels: This Isn't New

The reluctant adoption pattern has played out across industries:

### Cloud Computing: The Hybrid Cloud Mirage
Traditional IT vendors initially dismissed cloud as insecure. When market pressure mounted, they launched "hybrid cloud" solutions that recreated on-premise complexity in cloud environments. The result? Enterprises moved to cloud, but did so in ways that maintained their existing vendor relationships and operational models.

### Electric Vehicles: The Compliance Car Strategy
Traditional automakers dismissed EVs as impractical, then launched "compliance cars" that met regulatory requirements while reinforcing ICE superiority. These vehicles technically satisfied zero-emission mandates while maintaining the broader ecosystem that favored traditional vehicles.

### Financial Services: The Digital Banking Illusion
Banks dismissed fintech as risky, then launched "digital banking" initiatives that recreated traditional processes in mobile apps. The underlying fee structures, regulatory capture, and competitive moats remained intact—just with better user interfaces.

**The common thread**: In each case, incumbents used the language of transformation to prevent transformation.

## The Framework: How to Spot Reluctant Adoption

Based on this analysis, here's how to identify when an incumbent is practicing reluctant adoption:

### The Five Tells of Reluctant Adoption:

1. **Timeline Arbitrage**: They support the technology "when it's ready" but define readiness in ways that favor their existing solutions
2. **Performance Framing**: They emphasize the technology's limitations in ways that highlight their integrated solutions' advantages
3. **Integration Complexity**: They position themselves as essential for managing complexity, effectively recreating single-vendor lock-in
4. **Standards Participation**: They actively participate in standards bodies to ensure the "open" standard accommodates their proprietary advantages
5. **Customer Protection**: They frame resistance as protecting customers from immature technology

### Real-World Application: Reading Between the Lines

When Ericsson's CTO says "We believe in Open RAN, but customers need to understand the performance trade-offs," that's reluctant adoption in action. The statement appears reasonable—of course customers should understand trade-offs—but it subtly positions integrated solutions as the safe choice.

When Nokia's CEO claims "We're leading Open RAN development, but true multi-vendor deployments require careful orchestration," they're laying the groundwork for Nokia to be that orchestrator.

## Breaking the Cycle: A Path Forward

So how do we escape the reluctant adoption trap? Three strategies emerge:

### 1. **Demand True Multi-Vendor Commitments**
Operators must move beyond checking the "Open RAN" box and insist on deployments that actually mix vendors. This requires:
- **Contract Structure**: Require vendors to demonstrate interoperability with competitors before contract award
- **Performance SLAs**: Create service level agreements that hold all vendors accountable for integration success, not just individual components
- **Exit Clauses**: Build contracts that allow operators to swap vendors without full network replacement

### 2. **Create Alternative Procurement Models**
New procurement frameworks that evaluate multi-vendor solutions on their own terms:
- **RFP Design**: Specifically exclude single-vendor solutions from consideration
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Reward vendor diversity with scoring bonuses
- **Testing Frameworks**: Validate multi-vendor performance before deployment decisions

### 3. **Build Bypass Ecosystems**
Rather than trying to convince incumbents to embrace disruption, create alternative paths:
- **Independent Integration**: Support system integrators who aren't tied to specific vendors
- **Open Source Reference**: Build open-source implementations that work across vendors
- **Operator Consortiums**: Create shared integration costs and risks across multiple operators

**The critical insight**: These solutions require operators to accept short-term complexity for long-term flexibility—a trade-off that runs counter to the risk-aversion that makes reluctant adoption effective.

## The Bigger Picture: Lessons Beyond Telecom

The reluctant adoption framework extends far beyond telecom. We're seeing similar patterns in:

### Cloud Computing's "Hybrid" Reality
Traditional IT vendors "embrace" cloud while maintaining on-premise complexity through hybrid solutions. The result is cloud adoption that reinforces rather than disrupts existing vendor relationships.

### AI's "Responsible" Deployment
Tech giants warn about AI risks while positioning themselves as the only responsible stewards of the technology. This creates a regulatory moat that favors incumbents while appearing to address legitimate concerns.

### Renewable Energy's "Grid Stability" Concerns
Traditional utilities emphasize renewable energy's variability while positioning themselves as essential for grid stability. This maintains their central role while renewable adoption grows.

## Expert Insights: What Industry Leaders Say

John Baker, former Mavenir executive, [routinely updates industry analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnmarkbaker_crowd-sourced-openran-ecosystem-activity-7336795181129584641-2ih3) showing that just five vendors controlled 93% of all RAN sales in Q1 2025. His data reveals how the "open" ecosystem has been effectively captured by the same incumbents it aimed to disrupt.

Stefan Pongratz, Dell'Oro analyst, notes that Ericsson's market share in North America could be as high as 70%—a far cry from the diversified ecosystem Open RAN proponents envisioned.

**The expert consensus**: While Open RAN technology continues to mature, the market dynamics that were supposed to change have remained remarkably stable.

## The Question We're Not Asking

Here's the uncomfortable question: **What if the slow adoption of transformative technologies isn't a bug, but a feature of how established markets work?**

The reluctant adoption strategy works because it aligns with everyone's short-term incentives:
- **Incumbents maintain control**: They appear innovative while preserving market position
- **Operators reduce risk**: They get to check the "innovation" box without taking real risks
- **Governments show progress**: They can point to adoption metrics without disrupting established interests
- **Customers avoid disruption**: The technology arrives in familiar packaging

But this alignment comes at the cost of long-term innovation, competition, and value creation.

## Your Move

The next time you see an incumbent "embracing" a disruptive technology, ask yourself: Are they adopting the technology, or adopting control over the technology?

The answer will tell you everything about whether the revolution will actually arrive—or whether it will be managed into irrelevance.

**What patterns of reluctant adoption do you see in your industry? And how might we design systems that make this strategy less effective?**
