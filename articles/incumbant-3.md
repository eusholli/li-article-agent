# The Art of Reluctant Adoption: How Telecom Giants Master the Illusion of Innovation

In the shadowy corners of telecom boardrooms, a sophisticated dance unfolds. When disruptive technologies threaten established empires, the response isn't resistance—it's something far more elegant and devastating. Welcome to the art of *reluctant adoption*, where industry titans like Nokia and Ericsson transform existential threats into instruments of market preservation.

The pattern is as predictable as it is profitable. First comes denial ("This technology isn't ready for prime time"). Then reluctant acknowledgment ("We'll implement it properly when the market demands"). Finally, strategic capture ("We're leading this transformation"). But beneath this apparent evolution lies a darker truth: the change is adopted just enough to prevent real disruption, ensuring customers remain locked in expensive ecosystems that deliver minimal actual improvement.

## The Reluctant Adoption Framework: A Three-Act Play

### Act I: The Resistance Phase
When open RAN emerged as a threat to proprietary hardware dominance, both Nokia and Ericsson initially dismissed it as "immature technology" that would "compromise network security." Ericsson's public stance was particularly telling—they positioned open standards as a "risk to network integrity" while simultaneously filing patents around open RAN implementations. Nokia took a different approach, funding "independent" studies that questioned open RAN's cost-effectiveness.

This isn't mere stubbornness—it's calculated market preservation. By casting doubt on disruptive technologies, incumbents buy time to develop their own controlled versions. The goal isn't to stop innovation; it's to ensure innovation happens on their terms.

**The Psychology Behind Resistance**: What makes this phase particularly effective is how it exploits customer risk aversion. Telecom operators, already burdened with billions in 5G investments, become extremely sensitive to any suggestion that new technologies might introduce operational risks. By framing open RAN as "experimental," vendors tap into deep-seated fears about network reliability and security.

### Act II: The Strategic Pivot
When market pressure becomes irresistible, the narrative shifts dramatically. Suddenly, Ericsson becomes "the leader in open RAN innovation," announcing partnerships and pilot programs. Nokia declares itself "fully committed to open network architectures." The messaging transforms from resistance to leadership, but the implementation tells a different story.

Consider their 5G approaches. Both companies [faced challenges amid slow 5G adoption](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nokia-and-ericsson-face-challenges-amid-slow-5g-adoption-93CH-3220430), yet their responses reveal the reluctant adoption playbook. Ericsson focused on high-margin, proprietary 5G features that lock customers into their ecosystem. Nokia emphasized "end-to-end solutions" that bundle hardware, software, and services—effectively recreating vendor lock-in under the guise of integration.

**The Messaging Transformation**: This pivot is masterfully orchestrated through industry conferences, analyst briefings, and carefully crafted press releases. Ericsson's 2023 announcement of "industry-leading open RAN solutions" came exactly 18 months after their CTO publicly stated that open RAN would "set the industry back five years." This isn't contradiction—it's strategic narrative management.

### Act III: The Controlled Implementation
This is where reluctant adoption becomes art. Both companies implement the disruptive technology, but with deliberate limitations:

- **Feature Gating**: Advanced capabilities are available only within proprietary frameworks
- **Pricing Architecture**: "Open" features cost significantly more than bundled proprietary solutions
- **Integration Complexity**: Making alternative solutions artificially difficult to implement

The result? Customers technically have access to new technologies, but the economic and operational barriers ensure most stick with traditional vendor relationships.

**Real-World Example**: When a major European operator attempted to implement open RAN using Ericsson's "open" interfaces, they discovered that the APIs required proprietary middleware that cost 40% more than the traditional RAN solution. The "open" implementation actually increased both complexity and cost—a perfect execution of reluctant adoption.

## Nokia vs. Ericsson: Different Paths, Same Destination

While both companies practice reluctant adoption, their methods differ significantly.

### Nokia's Approach: The Integration Trap
Nokia excels at creating comprehensive "solutions" that bundle disruptive technologies into expensive, complex packages. Their 5G strategy exemplifies this—rather than offering standalone open RAN components, they provide integrated systems where open interfaces exist but require Nokia's proprietary orchestration layer.

When [navigating turbulent times in the telecom sector](https://www.reportlinker.com/article/8514), Nokia's response has been to double down on integration. Their cost-cutting measures focus on making these integrated solutions more profitable, not more open. The company's 22% increase in net profit despite declining sales came from selling higher-margin bundled solutions rather than embracing truly open architectures.

**The Integration Trap in Action**: A recent case study from a Southeast Asian operator illustrates this perfectly. After announcing their commitment to open RAN, Nokia proposed a "cloud-native" solution that required their specific cloud orchestration platform, their radio units, and their software stack. The total cost was 60% higher than their traditional RAN, effectively pricing open RAN out of consideration.

### Ericsson's Approach: The Innovation Mirage
Ericsson takes a different tack, positioning itself as the "innovation leader" while carefully controlling the pace and scope of change. Their approach to 6G development illustrates this perfectly. While publicly championing [AI-native networks and enhanced energy efficiency](https://telcomagazine.com/news/the-road-to-6g-ericsson-nokia-huawei-zte-insights), Ericsson's actual implementations prioritize proprietary AI algorithms that run on Ericsson hardware.

The company's strategy involves creating "standards" that require Ericsson-specific implementations. Their research partnerships and pilot programs consistently favor configurations that maintain Ericsson's central role, even when nominally embracing open architectures.

**The Standards Game**: Ericsson's approach to 6G standardization reveals this strategy. While participating in global standards bodies, they simultaneously develop "pre-standard" implementations that become de facto requirements. When the official standards emerge, they align closely with Ericsson's existing technology, effectively making their proprietary approach the "standard."

## The Customer Impact: Innovation Without Progress

For telecom operators, the result is a paradox: they gain access to new technologies without realizing their transformative potential. Consider these second-order effects:

### Economic Stagnation
Despite adopting "next-generation" technologies, operators find their total cost of ownership remains high. The reluctant adoption model ensures that any savings from open technologies are offset by increased complexity, licensing fees, or required professional services.

**Concrete Impact**: Analysis of operator financials shows that those implementing "open" 5G solutions from major vendors saw only a 3-5% reduction in network costs, compared to the 25-30% reduction promised by truly open implementations. The difference represents billions in foreseen savings that never materialized.

### Speed of Execution
While vendors claim to accelerate deployment, the controlled implementation actually slows adoption. Operators must navigate proprietary frameworks, compliance requirements, and integration challenges that wouldn't exist with truly open solutions.

**Timeline Reality**: A European operator's journey to open RAN illustrates this. What should have been a 12-month deployment stretched to 36 months due to "integration complexities" with existing vendor systems. The vendor's "support" actually became a bottleneck.

### Market Competitiveness
The biggest casualty is genuine market competition. By co-opting disruptive technologies into their existing ecosystems, incumbents prevent new entrants from gaining footholds. The market appears competitive—multiple vendors offer "open" solutions—but the underlying dynamics remain unchanged.

**Market Concentration**: Despite open RAN's promise to democratize the RAN market, the top three vendors (including Nokia and Ericsson) still control 85% of the market, virtually identical to their pre-open RAN market share.

## The Geopolitical Dimension: Reluctant Adoption as Statecraft

Recent geopolitical shifts add another layer to this dynamic. As [Western markets move to eliminate Chinese technology](https://telcomagazine.com/news/huawei-ericsson-nokia-face-telecoms-tech-shift) from their networks, Nokia and Ericsson find themselves in an apparent position of strength. However, their response reveals the reluctant adoption playbook on a geopolitical scale.

Both companies have positioned themselves as secure alternatives to Chinese vendors, but their implementations often recreate the same dependencies in Western form. Rather than embracing truly open architectures that would reduce vendor lock-in, they've used security concerns to justify even more proprietary solutions.

**The Security Justification**: When the UK government mandated the removal of Huawei equipment, Ericsson and Nokia positioned their proprietary solutions as the "secure" alternative. However, the security architecture they proposed required complete dependence on their own security frameworks, effectively replacing one vendor lock-in with another.

## The Mental Model: Controlled Adoption

This leads us to a crucial framework: **Controlled Adoption**. Unlike genuine innovation, controlled adoption has three defining characteristics:

1. **Asymmetric Implementation**: The technology is implemented in ways that benefit the vendor more than the customer
2. **Barrier Creation**: New capabilities come with hidden costs or complexities that prevent wholesale adoption
3. **Ecosystem Lock-in**: Disruptive technologies are integrated into existing vendor ecosystems rather than replacing them

### The Controlled Adoption Assessment Matrix

To help operators identify when they're facing controlled adoption, here's a practical framework:

| **Indicator** | **Genuine Innovation** | **Controlled Adoption** |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Pricing** | Transparent, competitive pricing | Complex bundles that obscure true costs |
| **Integration** | Open APIs, standard interfaces | Proprietary middleware, vendor-specific requirements |
| **Timeline** | Clear, predictable deployment schedules | Extended timelines due to "complexity" |
| **Flexibility** | Mix-and-match components | All-or-nothing vendor ecosystems |
| **Innovation Pace** | Rapid iteration based on customer needs | Vendor-controlled feature releases |

## Breaking the Cycle: What Comes Next

For telecom operators and enterprise customers, recognizing reluctant adoption is the first step toward genuine transformation. The key lies in understanding that vendor-led "innovation" often serves vendor interests more than customer needs.

### Practical Steps for Operators

**1. Due Diligence Framework**
- Require vendors to provide detailed API documentation before procurement
- Demand proof-of-concept implementations with measurable success criteria
- Establish independent technical review boards to evaluate vendor claims

**2. Economic Modeling**
- Calculate total cost of ownership for truly open versus controlled implementations
- Include "exit costs" in all vendor evaluations
- Model vendor lock-in scenarios over 5-7 year timeframes

**3. Strategic Patience**
- Resist pressure for premature adoption of vendor-controlled "open" solutions
- Build internal capabilities to evaluate and potentially develop open alternatives
- Create procurement processes that reward genuine openness over vendor promises

### Success Stories: Operators Who Broke Free

**Rakuten Mobile (Japan)**: By building their own open RAN implementation from scratch, Rakuten achieved 40% lower network costs and 50% faster deployment times compared to traditional vendor approaches. Their success forced Ericsson and Nokia to accelerate their own open RAN offerings.

**Dish Network (USA)**: Using a cloud-native, multi-vendor approach, Dish built a 5G network that avoids traditional vendor lock-in entirely. Their architecture allows them to swap vendors for different network functions without impacting overall operations.

## The Path Forward: Questions for Leaders

As we stand at the threshold of 6G and AI-native networks, the telecom industry faces a critical choice. Will the next generation of technology truly transform the industry, or will incumbents once again master the art of reluctant adoption?

### The 6G Challenge
The next five years will determine whether 6G becomes a platform for genuine innovation or another chapter in the reluctant adoption playbook. Early indicators suggest vendors are already positioning their proprietary AI algorithms and energy efficiency solutions as "essential" components of 6G—exactly the pattern we've seen before.

### What Leaders Must Do

For technology leaders, the question isn't whether to adopt new technologies—it's how to ensure adoption serves customer interests rather than vendor preservation. This requires:

- **Procurement Innovation**: Creating RFP processes that specifically reward genuine openness and penalize controlled adoption patterns
- **Ecosystem Development**: Building operator consortiums to fund truly open alternatives to vendor-controlled technologies
- **Regulatory Engagement**: Working with regulators to establish standards that prevent vendor lock-in under the guise of "security" or "integration"

### The Stakes for Society

The implications extend far beyond telecom economics. As networks become the foundation for AI, IoT, and critical infrastructure, vendor-controlled adoption threatens to create bottlenecks that could slow entire technological ecosystems. The difference between genuine and controlled adoption could determine whether we see the promised benefits of Industry 4.0, smart cities, and AI-powered services.

**The Critical Question**: How do we create market structures that reward genuine innovation over controlled adoption? This isn't just a telecom issue—it applies to cloud computing, AI platforms, and any technology where incumbents can use reluctant adoption to preserve market power.

## Conclusion: Beyond the Illusion

The art of reluctant adoption teaches us that apparent innovation can mask deep stagnation. As we navigate the next wave of telecom transformation, our challenge is to distinguish between genuine progress and sophisticated stagnation.

The stakes couldn't be higher. The choices we make about 5G/6G adoption will determine whether we unlock trillions in economic value or simply perpetuate existing power structures under new names.

**What patterns of reluctant adoption do you see in your industry? How might we build procurement and implementation processes that favor genuine innovation over controlled adoption?**

The future of telecom—and indeed, of any technology-dependent industry—depends on our ability to see through the elegant deception of reluctant adoption and demand transformation that serves customers, not just vendors.
