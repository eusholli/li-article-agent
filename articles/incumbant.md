# The Art of Reluctant Adoption: How Telecom Giants Master the "Embrace to Erase" Strategy

**When resistance becomes strategy, and adoption becomes control.**

In the telecom industry, there's a sophisticated dance that plays out whenever disruptive technology threatens established market leaders. The choreography is precise: first comes resistance, then reluctant acceptance, and finally a strategic embrace that effectively neutralizes the threat. This isn't mere adaptation—it's the art of **reluctant adoption**, where incumbents transform potential revolutions into controlled evolutions that preserve their dominance.

The latest performance of this dance centers on Open RAN, a technology designed to break the stranglehold of traditional equipment vendors. And no one executes this routine more masterfully than Nokia and Ericsson, the twin titans of Western telecom infrastructure who have perfected what I call the "Embrace to Erase" playbook.

## The $45 Billion Question: Why Open RAN Mattered

To understand why reluctant adoption works so effectively, we need to grasp the stakes. The global RAN market represents approximately [$45 billion in annual revenues](https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/how-ericsson-and-nokia-vanquished-the-open-ran-threat), with [RAN equipment consuming 60-80% of total network costs](https://www.parallelwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Wireless-e-Book-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-about-Open-RAN.pdf). When you're defending territory this valuable, the strategy isn't just about technology—it's about controlling the very definition of progress.

Open RAN promised to revolutionize this equation by standardizing interfaces between different vendors' equipment. Instead of being locked into a single supplier's proprietary ecosystem, operators could theoretically mix and match components like building blocks, potentially saving billions while fostering innovation. The vision was compelling: a truly open marketplace where best-of-breed solutions could compete on merit rather than vendor relationships.

But here's the critical insight: **the threat wasn't just technological—it was existential**. As recently as 2023, [Ericsson, Nokia, and Huawei controlled 75% of the global RAN equipment market](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/). This wasn't merely market share; it was a carefully constructed system of dependencies that made switching vendors economically prohibitive.

## Historical Precedent: The Lucent Lesson

To understand why Nokia and Ericsson fight so fiercely against disruption, we need to examine what happened to their predecessors. In 1999, [Lucent Technologies was the world's largest telecommunications equipment company](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/08/who-lost-lucent-the-decline-of-americas-telecom-equipment-industry/), earning $38.3 billion in revenue and $4.8 billion in profits. By 2006, Lucent's revenues had fallen 75% from their peak, and the company was ultimately absorbed into Alcatel, which Nokia later acquired.

The lesson wasn't lost on current incumbents. When disruptive technologies emerge, the choice isn't between adaptation and resistance—it's between **controlled adaptation** and **uncontrolled disruption**. Nokia and Ericsson learned from Lucent's fate that the key to survival isn't preventing change, but ensuring that change happens on your terms.

This historical context reveals the deeper strategic calculus: **the resistance phase isn't corporate stubbornness—it's strategic positioning to control the transition narrative**. The winners aren't those with the best technology, but those who define what "ready for deployment" means.

## The Resistance Phase: Engineering Doubt and Delay

Ericsson's initial resistance to Open RAN was textbook reluctant adoption. In 2021, the company [claimed Open RAN would be more expensive than traditional RAN and offer worse performance](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/do-the-incumbents-have-a-stranglehold-over-open-ran/). This wasn't just corporate posturing—it was the first movement in the reluctant adoption symphony, designed to buy time to understand how to neutralize the threat.

But Ericsson's resistance went deeper than public statements. The company leveraged its technical credibility to create what I call **"legitimate doubt"**—raising concerns that couldn't be immediately dismissed as self-interest. They pointed to integration complexities, performance trade-offs, and the risk of multi-vendor finger-pointing when problems arose. Each concern was technically valid, but the cumulative effect was strategic delay.

Nokia's resistance took a more subtle form. While Ericsson openly criticized Open RAN's technical merits, Nokia employed what I call **"cooperative obstruction"**—appearing supportive while ensuring their implementations maintained proprietary advantages. The company would make public statements about embracing open standards while simultaneously ensuring their Open RAN solutions included proprietary extensions that made multi-vendor deployments impractical.

This dual approach allowed Nokia to appear cooperative while effectively stalling meaningful adoption. When operators asked about Open RAN compatibility, Nokia could point to their "support" while steering conversations toward the superior performance of their integrated solutions.

## The Economic Reality Check: Why Resistance Eventually Fails

Resistance only works until market pressure becomes overwhelming. For Nokia and Ericsson, this pressure came from multiple directions simultaneously, creating what economists call a **"coordination cascade"**—when enough stakeholders shift their expectations that remaining resistant becomes more costly than adapting.

The pressure came from three critical sources:

**1. Geopolitical Imperatives**: With Huawei's [31% global market share](https://telcomagazine.com/news/huawei-ericsson-nokia-face-telecoms-tech-shift) under scrutiny due to security concerns, Western operators needed alternatives that didn't create new dependencies. Open RAN became a strategic imperative rather than just a cost-saving measure. The US government created a [$1.5 billion Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/), while the UK established a £295.5 million Open Networks Programme. These weren't just incentives—they were existential threats to the status quo.

**2. Customer Revolt**: When AT&T announced it would move [70% of its wireless traffic to open-capable platforms](https://www.fierce-network.com/tech/att-awards-14-billion-open-ran-contract-ericsson-dealing-blow-nokia), the message was clear: adapt or lose market share. The [$14 billion AT&T contract](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/att-chooses-ericsson-for-new-us-telecom-network-will-drop-nokia.html) represented more than revenue—it was a referendum on the future of network architecture.

**3. Regulatory Pressure**: Governments worldwide began viewing telecom infrastructure as critical national security infrastructure. This created political pressure for supply chain diversification that transcended traditional market dynamics. The incumbents realized that continued resistance might trigger regulatory intervention that could be far more disruptive than controlled adaptation.

## The Strategic Pivot: From Enemy to Architect

This is where reluctant adoption transforms from defense to offense. Both Nokia and Ericsson executed textbook pivots, each reflecting their corporate DNA and market position.

### Ericsson's Charm Offensive: The Aggressive Embrace

Ericsson chose the path of what I call **"offensive co-option"**—positioning themselves not just as participants in the Open RAN transition, but as its primary architects. The company launched what industry observers called a ["charm offensive"](https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/op-ed-tale-two-5g-giants-nokia-silent-ericsson-continues-charm-offensive), announcing partnerships with major operators and positioning themselves as the natural leader of the Open RAN transition.

The brilliance of Ericsson's approach lay in its comprehensiveness. They didn't just claim to support Open RAN—they positioned themselves as the only vendor capable of making it work at scale. Their Intelligent Automation Platform became the foundation for [AT&T's entire Open RAN deployment](https://the-mobile-network.com/2025/06/nokia-evolves-mantaray-to-open-ran-smo-solution/), effectively making them the gatekeeper of what was supposed to be an open ecosystem.

Ericsson's strategy revealed a crucial insight about reluctant adoption: **the goal isn't to prevent the new technology, but to ensure that implementing it requires your expertise**. By positioning themselves as the essential integrator, Ericsson transformed a threat to their business model into a feature of their business model.

### Nokia's Silent Consolidation: The Technical Moat Strategy

Nokia, true to its Finnish character, chose a more understated but equally effective strategy. Rather than declaring leadership, Nokia focused on ensuring their Open RAN solutions maintained proprietary advantages through what I call **"technical moats"**—features that make their solutions disproportionately difficult to replace.

Their MantaRay platform was positioned as [the only SMO platform meeting Level 4 automation specifications](https://the-mobile-network.com/2025/06/nokia-evolves-mantaray-to-open-ran-smo-solution/), effectively creating a new technical barrier to entry. While Ericsson courted attention, Nokia focused on technical integration that made their components "sticky" even in an open environment.

This approach reflected a deeper understanding of how reluctant adoption works in practice: **the appearance of openness matters more than the reality**. As long as Nokia could claim Open RAN compatibility while ensuring their solutions were technically superior or more integrated, they could maintain market position without appearing obstructionist.

## The Controlled Implementation: How "Open" Becomes Closed Again

This is where reluctant adoption reveals its true genius. Both companies have successfully transformed Open RAN from a threat to their business model into a feature of their business model, but the evidence lies in the implementation details.

Despite AT&T's much-publicized Open RAN contract, [Ericsson is effectively managing a single-vendor deployment](https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2eeran92ahre2zh243cw0/news/is-open-ran-dead-how-tier-1-vendors-took-over-the-open-ran-vision). They're integrating other vendors' equipment, but under Ericsson's orchestration and control. This isn't multi-vendor competition—it's single-vendor integration with extra complexity.

More telling is the market reality. Despite years of Open RAN promotion, [multi-vendor RAN will account for under 10% of the market in 2028](https://www.aethaconsulting.com/paving-the-way-to-open-ran-adoption/). The technology that was supposed to democratize the market has instead been captured by the same incumbents it was designed to challenge.

This pattern repeats across major deployments. When Vodafone deployed Open RAN in the UK, [they chose Samsung as their primary vendor](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/do-the-incumbents-have-a-stranglehold-over-open-ran/), but the remaining 70% of their network remained with Ericsson and Nokia. The pattern is consistent: new technology, same suppliers, controlled implementation.

## The Customer Impact: Same Lock-in, Different Label

The ultimate tragedy of reluctant adoption is that customers—the telecom operators and ultimately consumers—are left with the worst of both worlds. They bear the cost and complexity of transitioning to Open RAN without realizing its promised benefits.

Consider the economics in detail: traditional RAN equipment already represents [65-70% of total network costs](https://itif.org/publications/2020/04/27/us-national-strategy-5g-and-future-wireless-innovation/). The transition to Open RAN adds integration complexity, new software layers, and vendor management overhead without necessarily reducing these costs. [Many operators have found that Open RAN deployment costs may not be significantly different from traditional solutions](https://www.gsma.com/about-us/regions/asia-pacific/blog/apacpg/open-ran/).

Moreover, the promise of vendor diversity remains largely theoretical. The ecosystem of vendors providing Open RAN solutions [is still evolving](https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/technologies/networks/latest-news/industry-moves-to-execute-on-open-ran-potential/), but the major deployments remain dominated by the same incumbents. The result is increased complexity without increased competition.

## The Reluctant Adoption Framework: A Transferable Mental Model

This pattern extends far beyond telecom. After analyzing dozens of industries, I've identified the **Reluctant Adoption Framework**—a predictable sequence that incumbents use to neutralize disruptive threats:

### Phase 1: Strategic Resistance
- **Goal**: Buy time to develop counter-strategy
- **Tactics**: Technical criticism, regulatory concerns, customer education
- **Success Metric**: Delay adoption by 6-18 months
- **Key Insight**: Resistance isn't about preventing change—it's about controlling the narrative

### Phase 2: Narrative Shaping
- **Goal**: Define how the technology will be implemented
- **Tactics**: Participate in standards bodies, raise "legitimate" concerns
- **Success Metric**: Influence technical specifications to maintain advantages
- **Key Insight**: The winner isn't the best technology—it's whoever defines "ready for deployment"

### Phase 3: Controlled Embrace
- **Goal**: Position as the natural leader of the transition
- **Tactics**: Announce comprehensive support, launch major initiatives
- **Success Metric**: Become the preferred integration partner
- **Key Insight**: Transform from threat to opportunity by making yourself essential

### Phase 4: Selective Implementation
- **Goal**: Adopt the technology in ways that preserve market position
- **Tactics**: Ensure "open" solutions require your components
- **Success Metric**: Maintain pricing power and customer lock-in
- **Key Insight**: The appearance of openness matters more than the reality

### Phase 5: Market Capture
- **Goal**: Transform the threat into a competitive advantage
- **Tactics**: Leverage scale and integration to outcompete challengers
- **Success Metric**: Increase market share while appearing innovative
- **Key Insight**: Co-opt the disruption to strengthen your position

## The R&D Disparity: Why Challengers Can't Keep Up

A critical factor enabling reluctant adoption is the massive R&D advantage incumbents maintain. [Ericsson and Nokia together pour about $5 billion annually into R&D](https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/how-ericsson-and-nokia-vanquished-the-open-ran-threat), while challengers operate with tens of millions. This creates what Earl Lum of EJL Wireless Research calls a "moving target problem"—by the time challengers match current capabilities, incumbents have moved the goalposts.

This R&D advantage isn't just about technical capabilities—it's about controlling the definition of progress itself. When incumbents define what "ready for deployment" means, they can ensure that their solutions are always "more ready" than challengers', even in supposedly open ecosystems.

## Implications for Innovation Ecosystems: The Death of Creative Destruction

This dynamic has profound implications for how we think about technological disruption. When incumbents master reluctant adoption, the market dynamics shift from creative destruction to controlled evolution. This may explain why, despite massive investments in 5G and Open RAN, [telecom providers' growth rates lag behind other technology sectors at just 4-7% annually](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/technology-and-telecommunications-b2b-customer-buying-trends-bright-horizons-with-some-warning-signs).

The challenge for policymakers and innovators is recognizing when "adoption" becomes "co-option." True market disruption requires not just new technology, but new market structures that prevent incumbents from immediately absorbing and neutralizing threats.

## Breaking the Cycle: Counter-Strategies for True Innovation

Understanding reluctant adoption is the first step toward countering it. Here are specific strategies that could prevent the next wave of disruption from being domesticated:

### For Operators:
1. **Demand Genuine Multi-Vendor Proof**: Require vendors to demonstrate actual multi-vendor deployments, not just compatibility claims
2. **Separate Integration from Supply**: Use system integrators who don't also supply equipment
3. **Mandate Open Interfaces**: Require vendors to open APIs and interfaces to third parties

### For Policymakers:
1. **Condition Incentives on Diversity**: Tie government funding to actual multi-vendor deployments
2. **Support Alternative Integrators**: Fund independent system integration capabilities
3. **Monitor Market Concentration**: Track actual vendor diversity in deployments, not just announcements

### For Innovators:
1. **Design for Disintermediation**: Create technologies that don't require incumbent integration
2. **Build Alternative Ecosystems**: Develop complete solutions that bypass incumbent advantages
3. **Target Underserved Segments**: Focus on markets where incumbents have less control

## The Path Forward: Designing Innovation Ecosystems That Resist Co-option

The next wave of disruption—whether in AI, quantum computing, or 6G—will face the same reluctant adoption strategies unless we design systems that prevent their success. This requires rethinking not just technology, but the entire innovation ecosystem.

Key principles for resistant innovation:
- **Modular Architecture**: Ensure innovations can work independently of incumbent systems
- **Open Standards with Teeth**: Create standards that can't be subverted through proprietary extensions
- **Alternative Integration Paths**: Develop integration capabilities that don't rely on incumbents
- **Market Structure Design**: Create market mechanisms that reward genuine diversity

## The Question That Matters

The question isn't whether Nokia and Ericsson will master the next technological transition—it's whether we'll let them define what "mastery" means. The art of reluctant adoption succeeds because we mistake controlled evolution for genuine disruption.

**What patterns of reluctant adoption do you see emerging in your industry? How might we design innovation ecosystems that resist co-option while still benefiting from incumbents' resources and expertise?**

The future of technological progress may depend less on what we invent, and more on how we prevent those inventions from being immediately domesticated by the very forces they were meant to disrupt. The challenge isn't just creating new technologies—it's creating new ways for those technologies to reach markets without being captured by existing power structures.

*The greatest threat to innovation isn't failure—it's success that looks like failure dressed in different clothes.*
