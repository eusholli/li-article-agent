# Active Context - LinkedIn Article Generator

## Current Implementation Status

### Phase: Enhancement Complete
**Status:** Draft Scoping Feature Successfully Implemented  
**Target:** Enhanced article generator with draft analysis and consistency maintenance  
**Timeline:** Current session enhancement completed

### Latest Enhancement: Draft Scoping System

#### 1. New Draft Analysis Workflow
- **DraftScopingSignature:** Comprehensive analysis of input drafts before generation
- **Key Insights Extraction:** Identifies main theme, key points, target audience, core message
- **Content Gap Analysis:** Detects areas needing expansion for full LinkedIn article
- **Tone & Style Analysis:** Captures original voice and writing style preferences
- **Supporting Arguments Mapping:** Identifies existing evidence and areas needing strengthening

#### 2. Enhanced Generation Process
- **Scoped Generation:** ArticleGenerationSignature now uses comprehensive draft analysis
- **Consistency Maintenance:** Generated articles maintain fidelity to original key points
- **Improved Context:** Both generation and improvement phases reference original draft
- **Better Targeting:** Content expansion focuses on areas identified during scoping
- **Quality Preservation:** Ensures generated content stays true to original intent

#### 3. Updated System Architecture
- **Three-Phase Process:** Scoping → Generation → Iterative Improvement
- **Enhanced DSPy Signatures:** All signatures now include original draft context
- **Improved Data Flow:** Scoped analysis flows through entire generation pipeline
- **Better Tracking:** Generation log includes scoping insights and consistency measures

## Recent Decisions and Insights

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Import-Based Integration:** Use direct Python imports from li_article_judge.py rather than API calls
2. **DSPy Module Pattern:** Leverage ChainOfThought for structured LLM interactions
3. **Pydantic Validation:** Ensure type safety and data structure consistency
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Focus on incremental improvements rather than complete rewrites

### Key Technical Insights
- **Scoring Criteria Structure:** Well-organized dictionary in li_article_judge.py enables easy parsing
- **Weight Distribution:** Strategic Deconstruction & Synthesis (75 points) and First-Order Thinking (45 points) are highest weighted
- **Performance Tiers:** Clear thresholds provide concrete targets for optimization
- **Word Count Balance:** Must optimize for both quality and length simultaneously

### Implementation Patterns
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** System automatically adjusts to criteria changes
- **Multi-Constraint Optimization:** Balance score and word count requirements
- **Feedback-Driven Improvement:** Use scoring results to guide specific improvements
- **Error Resilience:** Robust handling of LLM response variations

## Current Work Session

### Completed Components
1. **Memory Bank Initialization:** Complete project documentation structure
2. **Project Brief:** Clear goals and success metrics defined
3. **Product Context:** User experience and value proposition documented
4. **System Patterns:** Architecture and design patterns established
5. **Technical Context:** Technology stack and constraints documented
6. **HTML Text Cleaning System:** ✅ NEW - Robust HTML content processing for RAG

### Latest Enhancement: Refactored Citation-Worthy Content Filter Integration

#### 1. Architectural Refactoring
- **Moved Citation Classes:** CitationFilter and CitationWorthyFilter relocated from rag.py to html_text_cleaner.py
- **Integrated Processing:** Citation filtering now happens within HTMLTextCleaner._apply_size_limiting()
- **Single Responsibility:** HTML cleaning and citation filtering unified in one module
- **Simplified RAG Pipeline:** TavilyRetriever now only calls clean_and_limit_passages() for complete processing

#### 2. Enhanced Size Management
- **Per-Passage Processing:** Citation filtering applied to each passage individually before size limiting
- **Smart Fallback:** If citation filtering brings content under 100K limit, no further truncation needed
- **Optimized Flow:** Citation filtering → Smart truncation (if still needed) → Final output
- **Better Control:** Ensures each passage stays under context window size constraints

#### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Cleaner Architecture:** Removed duplicate citation filtering code from rag.py
- **Unified Processing:** All content processing (HTML cleaning + citation filtering + size limiting) in one place
- **Error Resilience:** Citation filtering failures gracefully fall back to original passages
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed progress tracking through each processing stage
- **Type Safety:** Maintained List[str] typing throughout the pipeline

#### Previous Enhancement: HTML Text Cleaning System
- **HTMLTextCleaner Class:** Comprehensive HTML processing and size limiting
- **Web Scaffolding Removal:** Removes navigation, ads, and non-content elements
- **100K Character Limit:** Enforces context window size constraints
- **Smart Truncation:** Preserves sentence boundaries when limiting content
- **Multiple Parser Support:** Fallback parsers for robust HTML handling

### Next Implementation Steps
1. **Testing:** Validate HTML cleaning with real-world content
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Track cleaning effectiveness and speed
3. **Fine-tuning:** Adjust cleaning parameters based on content quality
4. **Documentation:** Update user guides with new RAG capabilities

### Active Considerations

#### Quality vs. Length Trade-offs
- **Challenge:** Maintaining high scores while meeting word count requirements
- **Approach:** Targeted expansion of weak scoring areas to increase both quality and length
- **Strategy:** Use scoring feedback to identify areas needing more detailed coverage

#### Criteria Adaptation Strategy
- **Dynamic Loading:** Import SCORING_CRITERIA at runtime for flexibility
- **Change Detection:** Monitor for criteria modifications between runs
- **Automatic Adjustment:** Adapt generation focus based on current criteria weights
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure system works with criteria updates

#### Performance Optimization
- **Model Reuse:** Cache DSPy model instances across iterations
- **Incremental Improvement:** Make targeted changes rather than complete rewrites
- **Early Termination:** Stop iterations when targets achieved
- **Resource Management:** Balance quality with API usage costs
