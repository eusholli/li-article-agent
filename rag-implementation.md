Excellent question. Yes, you absolutely can configure dspy.Retrieve to search the web.

The key to understanding this is that dspy.Retrieve is a modular interface. The actual retrieval logic is handled by the **Retrieval Model (RM)** you configure in dspy.settings.

To use web search, you simply need to create a custom Python class that acts as your Retrieval Model. This class will wrap a web search API (like DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Brave, or Google Search). As long as your class has a \_\_call\_\_ method that takes a query and returns a list of documents (strings), it can be used as an RM in DSPy.

Let's walk through a complete, practical example using the duckduckgo-search library, which is free and requires no API key.

### **Step 1: Install the necessary library**

First, you'll need to install the library for our web search provider.

Bash

pip install \-U dspy-ai duckduckgo-search

### **Step 2: Create a Custom Web Search Retriever Class**

We will create a new class, let's call it WebSearchRetriever, that will handle the logic of searching the web and formatting the results for DSPy.

Python

import dspy  
from duckduckgo\_search import DDGS

class WebSearchRetriever(dspy.Retrieve):  
    """  
    A custom retriever that uses DuckDuckGo Search to find relevant web pages.  
    """  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, k=5):  
        """  
        Initializes the retriever.  
          
        Args:  
            k (int): The default number of results to retrieve.  
        """  
        super().\_\_init\_\_(k=k)  
        self.ddgs \= DDGS()

    def forward(self, query\_or\_queries, k=None):  
        """  
        The core retrieval logic.  
          
        Args:  
            query\_or\_queries (str or list\[str\]): The query or queries to search for.  
            k (int, optional): The number of results to retrieve. Defaults to self.k.  
          
        Returns:  
            A list of dspy.Prediction objects, where each prediction contains the text of a search result.  
        """  
        k \= k if k is not None else self.k  
          
        \# DSPy's multi-query support  
        queries \= \[query\_or\_queries\] if isinstance(query\_or\_queries, str) else query\_or\_queries  
          
        all\_results \= \[\]  
        for query in queries:  
            \# Perform the search using DuckDuckGo  
            results \= self.ddgs.text(query, max\_results=k)  
              
            \# Format the results into a list of Prediction objects  
            \# We combine the title and snippet for better context.  
            formatted\_results \= \[  
                dspy.Prediction(long\_text=f"Title: {res\['title'\]}\\nSnippet: {res\['body'\]}")   
                for res in results  
            \]  
            all\_results.extend(formatted\_results)  
              
        return all\_results

*Notice:* We are inheriting from dspy.Retrieve and implementing the forward method. This is the modern, recommended way to create custom modules in DSPy. The forward method must return a list of dspy.Prediction objects.

### **Step 3: Configure DSPy to Use Your New Retriever**

Now, you configure dspy.settings to use an instance of your WebSearchRetriever as the default RM.

Python

import dspy  
import os

\# Configure the Language Model (e.g., from OpenAI)  
turbo \= dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo', api\_key=os.getenv("OPENAI\_API\_KEY"))

\# Instantiate your custom web search retriever  
web\_retriever \= WebSearchRetriever(k=3) \# Retrieve top 3 results

\# Set the default LM and our new RM  
dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo, rm=web\_retriever)

### **Step 4: Use it in Your RAG Program**

The beautiful part is that your RAG module from our previous discussion **does not need to change at all**. Its self.retrieve call will now automatically be routed to your WebSearchRetriever.

Let's test it with a question that requires up-to-date information. Given that today is August 10, 2025:

Python

\# The same RAG module as before  
class GenerateAnswer(dspy.Signature):  
    """Answer questions based on the provided context."""  
    context \= dspy.InputField(desc="may contain relevant facts")  
    question \= dspy.InputField()  
    answer \= dspy.OutputField(desc="often a concise response")

class RAG(dspy.Module):  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self):  
        super().\_\_init\_\_()  
        self.retrieve \= dspy.Retrieve() \# Will use the configured WebSearchRetriever  
        self.generate\_answer \= dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer)

    def forward(self, question):  
        context \= self.retrieve(question).passages  
        prediction \= self.generate\_answer(context=context, question=question)  
        return dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=prediction.answer)

\# \--- Let's run it\! \---  
rag\_with\_web\_search \= RAG()

\# Ask a question that requires live web access  
live\_question \= "What major movie was released in the summer of 2025 that features superheroes?"

response \= rag\_with\_web\_search(live\_question)

print(f"Question: {live\_question}")  
print(f"Answer: {response.answer}")

\# Let's inspect the retrieved context to see our retriever in action  
print("\\n--- Retrieved Context from the Web \---")  
for i, passage in enumerate(response.context):  
    print(f"\[{i+1}\] {passage}\\n")

This will now:

1. Take the live\_question.  
2. Pass it to dspy.Retrieve.  
3. DSPy routes this to your WebSearchRetriever.  
4. Your retriever calls the DuckDuckGo API.  
5. The search results (snippets) are returned as context.  
6. The LM generates an answer based on the fresh information from the web.

This demonstrates the power of DSPy's modularity. You can swap out the backend—from a static vector database to a live web search engine—with a simple configuration change, leaving your core program logic untouched. You could even compile and optimize your RAG program using a web-based retriever to teach it how to best handle real-world, dynamic data.
